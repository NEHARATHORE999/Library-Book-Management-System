# Library-Book-Management-System
A simple console-based application in C++ to manage a collection of books using basic data structures.
This project implements an efficient console-based library book management system using C++. It leverages an unordered_map for constant-time average complexity in book lookup, insertion, and deletion by unique book IDs. The system supports:

Adding new books with unique IDs, titles, and authors

Searching books by their ID

Removing books from the collection

Displaying all stored books in a formatted list

The design emphasizes clean modular code with separation of concerns, demonstrating practical use of data structures (hash maps) and basic algorithms to optimize operations in a real-world-like inventory scenario.
